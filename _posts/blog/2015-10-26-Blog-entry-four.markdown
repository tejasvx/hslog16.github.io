Traditional Approaches to train neural networks were to simply feed some input values to the network, based on the weights of that network , it will return some output and based on that output , it will calculate some loss if the labels are provided to it. But back in 2015 Ian Goodefellow proposed a new technique to train these networks, through that approach Mr. Goodfellow generated data by making the network learn the probability distribution function of that data. Today we will discuss about Generative Adversarial Networks.
